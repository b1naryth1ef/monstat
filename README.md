This was built from both a redis graph framework I threw together quickly, and from a barebones frontend app used at my job to track both internal devops stats, and external product information stats.

Stack:
- Redis
- Flask
- Flask-Websockets
- Schedule
- Highcharts

This is not close to finished at all, so be patient and fork!
